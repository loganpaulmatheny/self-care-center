# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
The Self-Care Center application is a health and wellness app, that can help users start their day on a more positive note. If you're like me, I start every day thinking about a gratitude and affirmation. And this app can help you think through them, save them to remember, and even add your own! 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
Option 1: 
- Download a zip file
- Navigate to the correct directory in your terminal and use the command `open index.html` to load the application into your default browser

Opetion 2: 
- Fork the repository
- Clone the repository using `git clone <copy github repository information - found vy clicking green code button>`
- Run the application from terminal with `open index.html`

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
- MVP and CYOA 1 - Error Handling: I probably worked on the base version for about 4 - 5 hours to complete the MVP with one CYOA task (basic error handling)
- CYOA For Fun: I worked on for several days days to work on in roughly 2 - 3 hour blocks. In total, I probably coded for around 7 additional hours including research and planning to make first versions of a clear button, add a message functionality, a favorites view, implementing local storage for favorites.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
A couple of my learning goals for this project included: 
- Technologies and tools: CSS, HTML, JS, local storage, flexbox, basic data types (arrays and objects), query selectors, event listeners
- Error handling: Learn the basics of error handling implementations
- HTML & CSS: Build a basic page layout and become more comfortable with CSS Flexbox
- Local Storage: Become comfortable leveraging local storage
- Productive: Get faster in thinking through and breaking down a problem into steps to be executed in order

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
**Wins**
- 

**Challenges**
- Views: Getting buttons, inputs, and visuals to come forward on the screen at the right times remains a challenege. The code code be refactored to have specific 'view' functions or error handling to not allow for the diverse button pattern combinations that leed to unexpected results. I solved most of these problems by trial and error and forced toggling of a function that would change `display: none`.
- Message Input: The thing that probably took the
- Flexbox: Getting the page to 'lool right' is probably what took the longest on this project. But I do feel I learned a great deal about flexbox and became more proficient with it by the end
